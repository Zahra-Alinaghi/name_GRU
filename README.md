"# name_GRU" 

In this project, we aim to predict the language/country of a name based on a dataset of names from different countries. To achieve this, we will use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to infer the nationality of a name by observing its characters.

The dataset for this project consists of a series of text files. Inside the train folder, you will find several text files with a .txt extension. The name of each file indicates the language/nationality of the names contained within that file, and each line in the corresponding file contains a single name. Additionally, the file test.csv contains a list of names for which you need to predict the nationality using your model.
